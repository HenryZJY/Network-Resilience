# Network-Resilience
Analyze the network resilience of three graph models. Each of them experiences targeted and random attacks (nodes are removed from the graph).
## Description
The purpose of this project is to analyze three graphs: a real world graph and two random generated graph based on upa and urdos-renyi models, in terms of their resilience against network attacks. 

## Files contained: 
1. A pdf of the algorithms of the three fundamental functions utilized in this project. There is also an analysis of their time complexity. 
2. Coding of the functions, graphs and attacks. 
3. A pdf of a detailed analysis of the resilience of the graphs on both targeted and random network attacks.
