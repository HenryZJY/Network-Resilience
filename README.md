# Network-Resilience
Analyze the network resilience of three graph models. Each of them experiences targeted and random attacks (nodes are removed from the graph).

The purpose of this project is to analyze three graphs: a real world graph and two random generated graph based on upa and urdos-renyi models, in terms of their resilience against network attacks.
